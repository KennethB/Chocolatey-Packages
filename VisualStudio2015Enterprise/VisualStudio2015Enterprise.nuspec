### Customizations
You can customize the installation either by specifying your own installation configuration file.
#### Adding optional features
Optional features (Sql tools, phone tools, etc.) are available but not installed by default.
To specify the features you want installed you can download the AdminDeployment.xml and modify it to support your needs.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KennethB/Chocolatey-Packages/master/VisualStudio2015Enterprise/Tools/AdminDeployment.xml
Specifying the optional features above modifies the configuration file used during installation (AdminDeployment.xml). If that is not enough you can provide this file on your own.
Example:
choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile c:\path to your\AdminDeployment.xml"
choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile http://path/to/your/AdminDeployment.xml"
